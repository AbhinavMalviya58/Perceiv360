                <p>The Partition of India was not a sudden call and the one only on the desire of Churchill. It was the
                    major outcome of the seed sown about 14 years prior (in 1933) far away from India in England in a
                    house in the streets of London by Chaudhary Rahmat Ali. He was the first person who demanded for a
                    separate nation for the Muslims to protect their soul rights . He published a pamphlet named
                <h3>
                    "Now orNever : Are we to live or perish forever".
                </h3>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="/New folder/img 1.jpeg" alt="">
                </p>
                <p>
                    The pamphlet was released by Rahmat Ali on January 28,1933 and indeed was the first document where
                    the
                    word Pakistan was used for the separate nation required for the welfare and freedom of Muslim
                    population
                    of the nation . The name Pakistan was a well derived short form made including the geographical
                    regions
                    that were required to make the nation. They were Punjab, Afghan ( North-West Frontier Province) ,
                    Kashmir, Sind and Baluchistan. According to Ali â€œ Pakistan was both a Persian and an Urdu word. It
                    was
                    composed of letters taken from names of all our (our was his word) South Asian Homelands i.e.
                    Punjab,
                    Afghania, Kashmir , Sindh and Balochistan. Again according to him it was the land of pure.

                <p>
                    Rahmat Ali at the time was pursuing a law course at the University of Cambridge. The pamphlet
                    addressed the British government and the Indian delegates at the Third Round Table Conference 1931.
                    It was aimed to preserve the so called rights of Muslims living in India which were endangered by
                    the growing chances of a non-Muslim government being formed in India under the leadership of Nehru.
                    Ali demanded Pakistan in the name of preservation of common heritage of Muslims. He wrote that " Our
                    brave but voiceless nation is being sacrificed on the altar of Hindu nationalism not only by the non
                    Muslims but to the lasting disgrace of Islam by our own so called leaders". The betraying Islamis
                    addressed here were those who were working relentlessly day and night either with Congress or some
                    other aggressive revolutionary groups and some who were just power seekers. Mohammed Iqbal, a
                    contemporary and a friend of Rehmat Ali was also in favour of a separate Muslim state but he did not
                    advocate the partition of the country rather he wanted a large Muslim province by amalgamating
                    Punjab, Sindh and North West frontier province and Balochistan into a big North Western province
                    within India. Letter on Iqbal and Ahmed would meet jinnah and plant the seats of partition into his
                    mind and he would make sure that this happens
                    After publishing this pamphlet Rahmat Ali thought of himself to have done great deed in raising the
                    voice of Muslims and to protect their solemn rights and ultimately he was going to be proclaimed the
                    founder of Pakistan.

                </p>
                <p>
                    However the things didn't go as planned. The formation of Pakistan followed the path which was full
                    of blood bath. Both Hindu and Muslims lost their lives in the riots resulted due to the Partition.
                    Around 50 million people lost their lives and much more of them were made to abandon their Homeland
                    and settle to either side of the border on the basis of their religion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Things also didn't go great for Rahmat Ali too. The nation which was proposed by him not even
                    allowed him to reside there when he returned from London in 1948 few months later after the death of
                    Jinnah. His estates were confiscated and he was ousted from the nation by that time Prime Minister
                    Liakat Ali. He ended up his life in solitude and great despair. He died two years later in 1951 all
                    alone. His body received cremation 20 days after his death when scholars of Cambridge University
                    arranged for his cremation on the order of their master.
                </p>

                    Astonishing it is , how something so ordinary from a guy not so significant resulted in a great
                    number of significant chaos, loss of lives and a series of bloody struggle between two nations who
                    were once singular all because someone decided to publish a pamphlet of chaotic ideas.

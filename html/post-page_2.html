                    Heinz Wilhelm Guderian ( 17 June 1888- 14 May 1954) was a general in the German army who is
                    popularly known among the historians as “Father of Blitzkrieg” for his contributions to the
                    technique of modern day warfare centralized along light armoured tanks. He can be best described as
                    “A remarkable man in terrible times”. <br>

                        <h3>General Heinz Guderian </h3>
                    </div>
                    First of all let us understand Blitzkreig. It is a form of warfare in which the attacking army cuts
                    deep through enemy defenses bypassing enemy strongholds, concentrating their all strength at a
                    single point instead of fighting on a wide frontier using fast moving armoured vehicles encircling
                    and pocketing large number of enemy troops spreading incoordination and confusion making them raw
                    meat for the following infantry to mop them up.

                    <h3>German Panzers used during WWII for Blitzkrieg</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Guderian was one of the biggest and earliest pioneers and improvers of armoured warfare who
                    revolutionized the tank warfare to a new next level. On his part he was a true nationalist who at
                    all cost wanted to contribute to the glory and defend the integrity of his motherland. He also had a
                    certain moral code of conduct which was unique in its own way. Despite being the central piece of
                    Germany’s early success in WWII , he clearly refused to participate or contribute anyhow to the Nazi
                    atrocities on jews. He would often argue with his superiors as his juniors. He was one of the very
                    few who would not only express his disagreements but would fiercely argue with the Fuehrer. He was a
                    good leader but never really possessed the ability to be a blind follower.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Heinz was a junior officer in the German army and was in his early stages of training in a command
                    center which majorly focused on improving radio coordination between ground troops in the
                    battlefield when the WWI broke out . He after completing his training was designated as a staff
                    officer during the war itself. After the war there was a discontent in the army officers and they
                    believed that they did not lose the war in the battlefield but due to the cowardness of their
                    witless politicians which smoothened the rise of fascists in Germany and Hitler was the face of
                    their leadership.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the war Guderian was impressed by the effectiveness of the way the British tanks drove German
                    army backwards deep in the countryline and pocketed large number of German troops disrupting
                    co-ordination He extensively read the works of Lidell Hart and Fuller and was really taken into
                    believe that evolving and using light tanks in a radically new way will prove effective in the
                    upcoming wars. Guderian came up with a simple ideology – “ if you want to hit someone in the face,
                    you hit him with your fist not with your fingers widespread” .
                </p>
                <p>
                    A after being promoted to the rank of Major in 1927, Guderian was put in charge of motor units but
                    his primary work there was to deal with logistics and transport vehicles. In an attempt to modify
                    machine warfare Guderian put some machine guns on fast moving vehicles but was immediately stopped
                    and opposed by his superiors. His real nourishing and exposure came in 1929 Kazan visit when he was
                    sent to a secret tank testing facility developed in partnership with the Russians and the Weimar
                    Republic. There he freely put forward his ideas and exchanged experiences with his Russian
                    counterparts who had little idea they would be on the south side of the battlefield against him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1933, Guderian was made colonel in the German army. His articles and research works have gained
                    attention of top military thinkers and leaders throughout the world including the leader of Nazi
                    party that was swiftly rising to power. When Hitler started rearmament Guderian was put incharge of
                    the Panzer division.
                <p>
                    In Early 1934 when Hitler was demonstrated with the Panzer division, Hitler was quite amused with
                    their ability to swiftly cut across long distance. Guderian recalls Hitler's reaction as " the
                    chancellor was much taken by the speed and precision of movement of our units and said repeatedly '
                    That's what I need !' ". This demonstration made Hitler believe in doctrine of Guderian and from
                    then he provided every possible support to Guderian until the outbreak of the war. With overwhelming
                    support from the Fuhrer himself Guderian was already punching above his weight and that made him
                    somehow unpopular in the eyes of his superiors. This difference would later surface on the
                    battlefield when the superiors did not agree with Guderian's plans and it would cost the German army
                    very dearly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first real demonstration of Blitzkrieg came when Germany invaded Poland on September 01, 1939.
                    The Pols were not only outnumbered but they were also very primitive with cavalry brigades riding on
                    the backs of horses and lances. Britain and France declared war on Germany in support of Poland on
                    Sept 03, 1939 but by that time Poland was encircled and a series of surrenders was already underway.
                    The German panzers cut deep through Polish territories with two major pincer movements one aimed to
                    meet near Warsaw (the Polish capital ) and the outer one at Brest-Litovsk .Unlike Germany the Polish
                    army dispersed its tanks to support its infantry which was already stretched defending the long
                    Polish borders which made very less number of tanks at a point and were of no consequential effect.
                    The skies were dominated by the new breed German Airforce “ Luftwaffe” whose strength seemed
                    unmatchable by its rivals due to its new breed of Stuka Dive bombers and it completely wiped out the
                    Polish airforce within first 2 days of the battle. The Pols fought bravely but were no match for
                    their German counterparts . Legend even has it that some Polish cavalry charged on the German
                    panzers on their horsebacks but were brutally brushed aside. The Polish campaign was successfully
                    accomplished within a month of its start with last two weeks majorly spent conquering Warsaw that
                    offered stiff resistance.

                    The success of the Polish campaign made Hitler believe in Guderian’s Blitzkreig warfare . But this
                    was just the start of the series of grand success that this form will provide Germany in the first
                    two years of the war. We will discuss it in next installment of this post which will be put up soon
                    as we do not want to unnecessarily drag it long and make it unreadable in one instance.
